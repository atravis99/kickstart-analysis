Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis. 
  The purpose of this analysis is to understand the story data tells us. The tools of Excel can be utilized in many different ways, including tracking trends, budgeting, etc. If     there is a tangible way to interact with something there is a data set. Learning how to manage large sets of that data and sort, file, and categorize it effectively and     efficiently is a very necessary real world skill, even down to shopping lists.
## Analysis and Challenges: Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.
  I utilized the functions and used the provided cheat sheet resources available to further expand on them. I followed the module very closely and watched all the videos. I had  trouble with manually entering in some functions and data sets. I resolved this by copying and pasting to apply to a whole column and change individual factors to save time.
## Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
  One conclusion you could draw regarding this data set, found here, ![theater_outcomes_vs_launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96352415/148862861-0cda4b3b-e1b4-4601-84c3-191ec2c19f1e.png) is that during the months of May and June, there was a spike in success as well as failure rates. By default, we can assume (and refer to the data table) representing the two highest total amounts in that year that the summer months have the highest influx of introduced plays, and therefore have the most failures as well. We can also see that despite October having a 50 failed plays, none were cancelled.
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  The safest goals to successfully meet according to outcomes based on goals, ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96352415/148862977-51e0d72c-1475-46c4-9525-12da23916630.png) are either less than 4,999 or between 35,000-49,999.
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
  There is a numerical limitation of up to 5,000. Additionally, sample size and participatory sample bias such as types of plays, music, or shows could create outliers if there is not an equal distribution between each category.
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  We could create a stacked bar chart as we did in the modules, plot chart, statistical chart, box and whiskers. Furthermore you could go a little farther to pursue separation of categories other than theater, such as movies, to see what was most viewed or backed and what shows failed during the same time.
